1)Arithmetic operators in c

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operators
+	:add
eg: c=a+b
-	:substract
eg: c=a-b	
*	:multiplication
eg: c=a*b
/	:division
eg: c=a/b
%	:division remainder
eg: c=a%b
++	:increment the value of a variable by 1
eg: ++a
--	:1 degrement the value of a variable by 1
eg: ++b

2)Relational Operators in c

Relational operators are used to create realtions and compare the value of two operants.

Operators
equals to(==)   : it compare two operants and return 1 if both operants are same
eg:a==b
not equals(!=) : it compare two operants and return 1 if both operants are not same
eg:a!=b
less than(<)   :it check whether the left operant is less than the right operant
eg:a<b
greater than(>): it check whether the left operant is greater than right operant
eg:a>b
less than or equals to(<=)   : it check whether the left operant is less than or equals to right operant
eg:a<=b
greater than or equals to(>=): it check whether the left operant is greater than or equals to right operant
eg:a>=b

3)Logical operations in c

Logic operations are used to find logics between two operants

operators

&&	:And
eg: x<5&&x<10
||	:OR
eg:x<5||x<10
!	:Not
eg:!(x<3&&x<10)


4)Assignment operators in c

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables


operators

=	:eg:x=4
+=	:eg:x+=4 is same as x=x+4
-=	:eg:x-=4 is same as x=x-4
*=	:eg:x*=4 is same as x=x*4
/=	:eg:x/=4 is same as x=x/4
%=	:eg:x%=4 is same as x=x%4
&=	:eg:x&=4 is same as x=x&4
|=	:eg:x|=4 is same as x=x|4
!=	:eg:x!=4 is same as x=x!4
^=	:eg:x^=4 is same as x=x^4
<<=	:eg:x<<=4 is same as x=x<<4
>>=	:eg:x>>=4 is same as x>>4



5)Bitwise operators


bitwise operators are used to perform operations on bit level

operators

bitwise And(&)	:
eg:a=0110
   b=0100
   Result=0100
bitwise OR(|)	:
eg:a=0110
   b=0100
   c=0110
bitwise excusive OR(^)

bitwise compliment operation(~):
eg a=0110
   result=1001


6)Conditional operators

conditional operators are decision making statements which depend upon the output of the expressions 

syntax
expression1?expression2:expression3;

eg: b=((a==5)?(3):(2));


7)Shift Operators


shift operators is used to shift the binary bits either left direction or right direction according the program's requirements.

types
1)left shift  : used to shift the binary bits to left
eg:num=(num<<2) 
2)right shift : used to shift the binary bits to right
eg:num=(num>>2)
